House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned was ultimately forgiven and sent to the Wall. He takes his oath and becomes a Ranger, seeking out his long-lost brother, BenJen Stark. There are many descriptions of his meals and scenes of him plodding about alone past the Wall, where he encounters the Winter King, who ends up being BenJen. It's pretty unsatisfying in general because he goes to head back to the Wall and he ultimately freezes to death, possibly, we aren't sure though because the chapter is vague and ambiguous. We just know he gets trapped under a bunch of snow and presumably suffocates to death and is excluded from an entire book. There's a ton of symbolism and most of his chapters are flashbacks.
